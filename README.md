Project Overview

Records Management System the management of records for an organization throughout the 
records-life cycle. The purpose is to manage all the records of individuals. We saw the struggle of 
the employees in encoding the records so, We’ve come up on making this system for the LGU’s 
Rural Health Unit, we named our system “LILIW RHU VACCINATION RECORDS SYSTEM” 
for easy keeping of the individuals that administered and to check the number of the people who 
received, first dose, second dose and a booster shot. And what is great in our system is you can 
verify records easily and add individuals information in the system. And Lastly you can see the 
number of brands of vaccines that are administered in the Municipality of Liliw.
